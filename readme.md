# GCP DevOps Project

This repository contains the code and configurations for an end-to-end DevOps project demonstrates a complete DevOps lifecycle, including setting up a Python Flask application, deploying it on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Kubernetes, and implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated software delivery.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world DevOps workflow, executed in a sprint-based format on GCP. It covers the key stages of the DevOps lifecycle: planning, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring. The goal was to deploy a Python Flask application on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on GCP, with a CI/CD pipeline to streamline development and production workflows.

### Key Features
- **Python Flask Application**: A web application built with Python Flask, containerized using Docker.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deployed the application on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster for scalability and reliability.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions.
- **GCP Integration**: Leveraged GCP services like GKE, Cloud Build, and Container Registry for cloud-native deployment.
- **Sprint-Based Workflow**: Organized tasks into sprints, following industry-standard practices for planning and reviewing deliverables.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: GKE, Container Registry, Cloud Build
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration
- **Docker**: For containerizing the Flask application
- **Python Flask**: For the web application
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline
- **Linux**: For environment setup and scripting
- **GitHub**: For version control and repository management
